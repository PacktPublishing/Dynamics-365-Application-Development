## About the Book
Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM is the most trusted name in enterprise-level customer relationship management. Thelatest version of Dynamics CRM comes with the important addition of exciting features guaranteed to make your life easier. It comes straight off the shelf with a whole new frontier of updated business rules, process enhancements, SDK methods, and other enhancements.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The book is based on UI testing only chapter 08 has code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
Request: GET [Organization URI] /api/data/v9.0/contacts?
  $select=firstname&$top=5
  Accept: application/json
  OData-MaxVersion: 4.0
  OData-Version: 4.0
```

This book assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of Dynamics CRM and would like to learn the new features introduced in Dynamics 365. However, someone who hasn’t worked with the previous versions and is starting afresh with Dynamics 365 will equally benefit from it. Developers, customizers, administrators, and power users will be able to enhance their skills by learning about the latest features and changes introduced in Dynamics 365.

You can try out all the features and topics mentioned in the book using a trial instance of Dynamics 365 (https://trials.dynamics.com/) along with the free community edition of Visual Studio 2017 (https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Some of the topics covered do not apply to the on-premise version of Dynamics 365
